## 1. System Architecture Overview
The architecture consists of a scalable microservices framework that allows seamless integration of various components. The system is designed to handle high loads and enable easy updates to different parts without downtime.

## 2. Data Structures and Schemas
Define data to support user accounts, transactions, monitoring, and reporting. Use JSON and SQL for serialization and structured data requirements.

### Examples:
- **User Schema**: { id: string, name: string, email: string }
- **Transaction Schema**: { id: string, user_id: string, amount: number }

## 3. API Endpoints and Specifications
A comprehensive list of RESTful API endpoints including authentication, data retrieval, and modification. Each endpoint should specify method, request/response format, authentication requirements, etc.

### Examples:
- `GET /api/users` - Retrieves users
- `POST /api/transactions` - Submits a new transaction

## 4. UI/UX Layouts
Detailed layouts for each UI component including mobile responsiveness and accessibility guidelines. Include wireframes and user journey maps.

## 5. Backend Components
