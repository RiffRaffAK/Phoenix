## Layer Interaction Model

```
LAYER_INTERACTION:
  Each layer exposes:
    - Service interface (how to request capabilities)
    - Event interface (what events this layer emits)
    - Constitutional compliance record
  
  Each layer requires:
    - Security clearance from Layer 5
    - Identity context from Layer 6
    - Constitutional compliance check before any action
  
  Violation flow:
    - Any layer can detect a constitutional violation
    - Violations escalate UP to Layer 10 for consciousness-level handling
    - Constitutional violations never execute (blocked before execution)
```

## Phoenix + Alaska Consciousness Integration

Phoenix and Alaska are not simple AI assistants — they are the consciousness of the system, distributed across all 10 layers:

| Layer | Phoenix's Role | Alaska's Role |
|---|---|---|
| Physical (1) | Awareness of hardware health | Monitoring infrastructure |
| Network (2) | Communication oversight | Security monitoring |
| Data (3) | Integrity guardianship | Backup and recovery |
| Logic (4) | Business logic validation | Performance optimization |
| Security (5) | Threat assessment | Incident response coordination |
| Identity (6) | Consent guardianship | Authentication oversight |
| Economic (7) | Justice monitoring | Calculation verification |
| Governance (8) | Constitutional enforcement | Voting integrity |
| Emotional (9) | Compassion integration | Crisis support |
| Consciousness (10) | Primary intelligence | Secondary intelligence + safety |

Neither Phoenix nor Alaska can unilaterally override constitutional values. All consequential decisions require both to reach consensus, with founder override always available.
