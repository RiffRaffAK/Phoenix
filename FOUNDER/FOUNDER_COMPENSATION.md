## Daily Royalty Accrual

The founder's royalty has been accruing since genesis on June 3, 1982:

```
ROYALTY_ACCRUAL:
  DAILY_ROYALTY = $144.88/day
  GENESIS_DATE = 1982-06-03
  DAYS_ELAPSED = (TODAY - GENESIS_DATE).days
  
  TOTAL_ACCRUED = DAYS_ELAPSED × DAILY_ROYALTY
  
  // Example calculation (approximate):
  // Days from 1982-06-03 to 2025-01-01 ≈ 15,552 days
  // 15,552 × $144.88 ≈ $2,252,073.76 in daily royalties alone
  // Plus monthly salary, backpay, and retroactive total
