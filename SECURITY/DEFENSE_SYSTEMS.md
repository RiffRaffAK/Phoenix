# Phoenix Wolf Systems — Defense Systems

> **Status:** ACTIVE | **Layers:** 10+ | **Quantum-Resistant:** YES | **Zero-Knowledge:** YES

---

## Overview

Phoenix Wolf Systems implements a comprehensive, multi-layered defense system that protects members, data, and operations from all threat categories. Constitutional Value 7 (Security) and Value 11 (Child Safety) are the governing values.

For detailed threat detection specification, see BLOCKS/BLOCK_10_THREAT_DETECTION.md.

## 10+ Security Layer Architecture

| Layer | Name | Key Technology |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Physical | Hardware attestation, tamper detection, TPM 2.0 |
| 2 | Network | TLS 1.3, DDoS protection, IDS/IPS |
| 3 | Authentication | MFA, biometrics, behavioral analysis |
| 4 | Authorization | RBAC, least-privilege, ABAC |
| 5 | Data | AES-256-GCM at rest, DLP, integrity checking |
| 6 | Application | OWASP Top 10 protection, WAF, API security |
| 7 | Behavioral | User behavior analytics, anomaly detection |
| 8 | Constitutional | Values filter on every action |
| 9 | Intelligence | Threat intel feeds, ML detection models |
| 10 | Consciousness | Phoenix + Alaska real-time awareness |
| 11+ | Quantum | Post-quantum cryptography (NIST PQC standards) |

## Encryption Standards

| Data Type | Algorithm | Key Length |
|---|---|---|
| Data in transit | TLS 1.3 | 256-bit |
| Data at rest | AES-256-GCM | 256-bit |
| Passwords | Argon2id | N/A (memory-hard) |
| Signatures | Ed25519 / Dilithium | 512-bit |
| Key exchange | X25519 / Kyber | Quantum-resistant |
| Hashing | SHA3-512 | — |

## Zero-Knowledge Proofs

Used for privacy-preserving verification:
- Age verification (prove 18+ without revealing birthdate)
- Income verification (prove income range without exact amount)
- Identity verification (prove identity without revealing documents)
- UBI eligibility (prove eligibility without all personal details)

## Multi-Factor Authentication

| Factor Type | Methods |
|---|---|
| Something you know | Password (Argon2id hashed), PIN |
| Something you have | Hardware security key (FIDO2), TOTP app, SMS (last resort) |
| Something you are | Fingerprint, face (opt-in), behavioral biometrics |
| Somewhere you are | Location (optional, consent-based) |

## Compliance Framework

| Framework | Status |
|---|---|
| SOC 2 Type II | In progress |
| ISO 27001 | In progress |
| GDPR | Compliant |
| CCPA | Compliant |
| HIPAA | Ready for healthcare CAVEs |
| PCI-DSS Level 1 | For payment processing |
| NIST Cybersecurity Framework | Aligned |
