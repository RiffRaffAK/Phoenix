# BLOCK 2: Death, Genealogy, Inheritance & Wage Calculations

## Genealogy Management  
Genealogy management involves the systematic organizing and maintaining of family history which often includes tracing lineage, building family trees, and documenting ancestry. It plays a crucial role in understanding familial relationships and inheritance rights. In this system, features such as family member records, relationship mapping, and historical information storage are pivotal. You can implement this through:  
- **Creating Family Trees:** Visual representations of ancestry to track lineage.  
- **Inputting Individual Records:** Storing data related to each family member's birth, marriage, death, and any significant events.  
- **Relationship Graphs:** Tools to display connections between family members.  

## Death Processing  
Death processing includes the procedures and record-keeping necessary upon a family member's passing. This entails:  
- **Notification System:** Alert relevant family members about the passing.  
- **Death Records Maintenance:** Storing vital data such as date of death, causes, and certificates.  
- **Legal Documentation:** Handling wills or estate matters following death, ensuring that all legalities (e.g., probate processes) are duly followed.  

## Marriage and Divorce Handling  
In any genealogy system, managing marital relationships is essential.  
- **Marriage Records:** Documenting the union of family members, including dates and locations.  
- **Divorce Processing:** Recording divorce events with relevant details.  
- **Relationship Status Updates:** Continuously updating family trees to reflect marital changes.  

## Real-Time Wage Calculations  
Wage calculations are vital for managing any inheritance or family estate, particularly when dealing with shared finances.  
- **Dynamic Wage Calculating:** Implement a system that calculates wages in real-time based on specific factors such as:  
  - **Position:** Job roles may define base pay ranges.  
  - **Jurisdiction:** Different regions may have varied minimum wages and tax implications.  
- **Data Integration:** Pull in real-time data from employment databases or payroll systems to ensure accuracy.  

### Summary  
This block covers the implementation of genealogy management systems, processing death events with the necessary documentation, managing marriages and divorces, and ensuring that wage calculations are performed seamlessly in real-time. Each element is designed to integrate closely, providing a cohesive structure to genealogical records as well as financial tracking.
