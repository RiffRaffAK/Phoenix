# BLOCK 11: Day Zero Migration

## Overview
Day Zero Migration defines the complete strategy and procedures for onboarding existing systems, users, data, and financial records into the Phoenix Wolf Systems platform with zero downtime and full data integrity.

## Migration Objectives
- Preserve all historical data with accurate timestamps
- Maintain continuity of financial ledgers and wage records
- Transfer users with no interruption to access or services
- Apply Constitutional Values retroactively from system genesis
- Establish full audit trails from the moment of migration

## Pre-Migration Checklist
1. Source system inventory complete
2. Data schemas mapped to Phoenix structures
3. Encryption keys generated via Electrical Handshake Lock
4. Rollback checkpoints established
5. Legal compliance verified for all jurisdictions
6. User notification sent with migration timeline
7. Cave registrations prepared for all business entities
8. Wallet structures initialized for all users

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Data Extraction
- Export all records from legacy systems in standardized formats (JSON, CSV, SQL)
- Validate data integrity with cryptographic checksums
- Tag all records with source system identifiers and extraction timestamps

### Phase 2: Data Transformation
- Map legacy schemas to Phoenix Wolf Systems data structures
- Apply Constitutional Values flags to historical transactions
- Calculate retroactive wage compliance adjustments
- Generate genealogy records from user relationship data
- Assign industry classifications to all business entities

### Phase 3: Secure Transfer
- All data encrypted with AES-256 + RSA-4096 + User Key (three-layer encryption)
- Transferred over Pixel Internet mesh with acoustic sonar failover
- Each packet verified with immutable ledger checksum
- Transfer rate monitored; auto-pause triggers if anomaly detected

### Phase 4: Validation & Activation
- Full integrity audit comparing source and destination records
- Constitutional compliance check on all migrated transactions
- User identity verification via Electrical Handshake Lock
- Dual wallet initialization with migrated balances
- Cave status set to 🟢 Active for compliant entities

### Phase 5: Legacy Decommission
- Source systems placed in read-only archive mode for 90 days
- User redirect infrastructure maintained during transition
- Final export snapshot stored in immutable ledger
- Decommission confirmed after 90-day clean operation period

## Rollback Protocol
If migration integrity falls below 99.99%:
1. Halt migration immediately
2. Restore from last clean checkpoint
3. Generate discrepancy report
4. Notify affected users
5. Root cause analysis before retry

## Zero-Downtime Architecture
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Migration runs in parallel with live systems
- **Traffic Switching**: Users routed to Phoenix incrementally (10% → 50% → 100%)
- **Synchronization Buffer**: Real-time sync between legacy and Phoenix during transition
- **Fallback Layer**: Automatic reversion if error rate exceeds threshold

## Post-Migration Monitoring
- 30-day enhanced monitoring period after full cutover
- Daily reconciliation reports for all financial ledgers
- Weekly compliance audits for all migrated caves
- User satisfaction surveys at Day 7, Day 30, Day 90
