# Foundational System Architecture

## Time-Sequential Core
The time-sequential core is designed to process events in the order they are received. This ensures that data integrity is maintained and that the state of the system reflects the reality of events.

## HTML Memory Storage System
The HTML memory storage system leverages browser capabilities to store data in a format that is both human-readable and easily manipulable. This allows for efficient retrieval and updating of information, using standard web technologies for seamless integration with the application.

## Key Components
- **Event Queue:** Manages incoming events and ensures they are processed in a timely manner.
- **Data Storage:** Interfaces with the HTML storage, ensuring data is saved and retrieved as needed.
- **State Management:** Maintains the current state of the application based on processed events and stored data.

## Conclusion
This document outlines the foundational aspects of the system architecture, focusing on how the time-sequential core and HTML memory storage system work in tandem to create a robust application.
