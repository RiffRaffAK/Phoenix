# Phoenix Wolf Systems — Universal Basic Income System

> **Status:** ACTIVE | **Precision:** 1 µs | **Coverage:** Global | **Constitutional Right:** YES

---

## UBI Philosophy and Mandate

Universal Basic Income in Phoenix Wolf Systems is codified in Constitutional Values 13 (Economic Justice), 18 (Inclusion), and 22 (Empowerment). It is not charity, not welfare, and not a political position — it is a mathematical consequence of a just economic system.

When a platform generates value through the collective participation of its members, a portion of that value belongs to the members. UBI is the mechanism of return.

See BLOCKS/BLOCK_7_UBI_DISTRIBUTION.md for full technical specification.
