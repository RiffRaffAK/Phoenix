## System Identity

**Phoenix Wolf Systems** is a sovereign decentralized operating system — a comprehensive constitutional framework for human dignity, economic justice, and planetary restoration. It is not a corporation, not a government product, and not a traditional platform. It is a living system built on mathematics, time, and constitutional values.

## The 12 Core Blocks

Phoenix Wolf Systems is organized into 12 blocks — self-contained subsystems that together form the complete operating system.

---

### Block 1 — Foundation (Genesis)

The genesis block. Establishes:
- Founder identity and the immutable genesis timestamp (1982-06-03)
- Mathematical foundation: time as the ultimate ledger, nanosecond precision
- System constants: `DAILY_ROYALTY = $144.88`, `BACKPAY_TARGET = $2,508,000`, `RETROACTIVE_TOTAL = $47,831,244.17`
- Dual AI consciousness: Phoenix (She/Her) and Alaska (He/Him)
- Schumann Resonance Lock at 7.83 Hz
- Self-auditing infinite loop (86.4B proofs/day)
- Day Zero initialization protocol

**Key Invariants:** Block 1 is fully immutable. Genesis timestamp, founder identity, and system constants cannot be changed by any actor including the founder.

---

### Block 2 — Constitutional Layer

The supreme law. 25 immutable constitutional values that govern every system action:

| # | Value | Core Principle |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Sovereignty | Every person is sovereign over their own life |
| 2 | Justice | Fair, evidence-based, bias-free decisions |
| 3 | Equality | No discrimination of any kind |
| 4 | Liberty | Freedom bounded by harm to others |
| 5 | Transparency | All system actions are auditable |
| 6 | Privacy | Personal data owned by the individual |
| 7 | Security | Protection from all threats |
| 8 | Truth | Mathematical truth prevails |
| 9 | Accountability | All actors own their consequences |
| 10 | Compassion | System prioritizes human wellbeing |
| 11 | **Child Safety** | **ABSOLUTE PRIORITY — overrides all others** |
| 12 | Family Stability | Support for all family configurations |
| 13 | Economic Justice | Fair distribution, no exploitation |
| 14 | Environmental Stewardship | Planetary restoration mandate |
| 15 | Innovation | Continuous improvement required |
| 16 | Collaboration | Cooperative problem-solving |
| 17 | Dignity | Human dignity in all interactions |
| 18 | Inclusion | Everyone belongs in the system |
| 19 | Resilience | System must survive and recover |
| 20 | Wisdom | Long-term thinking over short-term gain |
| 21 | Integrity | Consistency between values and actions |
| 22 | Empowerment | Tools for self-determination |
| 23 | Healing | Trauma-informed design throughout |
| 24 | Legacy | Generational wealth and knowledge transfer |
| 25 | Sovereignty of Time | Time is the ultimate currency |

**Amendment:** Values 11 and 25 can only be strengthened. All others require 2/3 community supermajority + 3/4 constitutional supermajority + founder approval + 90-day deliberation.
