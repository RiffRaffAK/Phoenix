# Phoenix Wolf Systems — Triple-Layer Voting System

> **Status:** ACTIVE | **Layers:** 3 | **Anti-Manipulation:** Active | **Immutable Ledger:** YES

---

## Overview

The Triple-Layer Voting System provides democratic governance across Phoenix Wolf Systems at three levels — individual direct democracy, community representative democracy, and constitutional supermajority governance. Every vote is recorded immutably, and vote manipulation is a Red Signal dysfunctional rule (Rule 16).

---

## Three Layers

### Layer 1 — Individual Vote (Direct Democracy)
**Scope:** Personal decisions, DEN governance, CAVE operational votes
**Voting Weight:** 1 person = 1 vote (equal suffrage)
**Quorum:** 50% of eligible voters
**Pass Threshold:** Simple majority (>50%)

**Use Cases:**
- DEN resource allocation decisions
- CAVE operational policies
- Local community decisions
- Personal sovereignty decisions (individual ratification)

### Layer 2 — Community Vote (Representative Democracy)
**Scope:** Platform-wide policies, UBI rate adjustments, feature proposals
**Voting Weight:** 1 person = 1 vote (representatives elected by communities)
**Quorum:** 30% of eligible community members
**Pass Threshold:** 2/3 supermajority

**Use Cases:**
- Platform policy changes
- Community bonus pool distribution
- Feature additions and changes
- Industry-specific rule updates

### Layer 3 — Constitutional Vote (Supermajority + Founder)
**Scope:** Constitutional value changes, fundamental system changes
**Voting Weight:** Community vote + founder approval
**Quorum:** 75% of registered members must participate
**Pass Threshold:** 3/4 supermajority + mandatory founder approval

**Use Cases:**
- Constitutional value amendments
- Core block architecture changes
- Governance structure changes
- Founder compensation adjustments

## Anti-Manipulation Safeguards

```
VOTE_INTEGRITY:
  - All votes recorded in immutable ledger
  - Statistical anomaly detection (Rule 16 enforcement)
  - Anonymous voting (identity linked to vote, but vote not publicly attributed)
  - Results transparent (aggregate counts public)
  - Audit trail complete
  - Third-party verification available
```

Vote manipulation (Rule 16) is a Red Signal — any confirmed manipulation immediately suspends the vote, preserves evidence, and triggers investigation.

## Voting Protocol

```
VOTING_CYCLE:
  1. Proposal submission (any member)
  2. Deliberation period (min 14 days for L1/L2, 90 days for L3)
  3. Impact assessment (AI modeling of outcomes)
  4. Voting window opens (30 days)
  5. Results tallied and verified
  6. Founder review (Layer 3 only)
  7. Implementation (staged rollout)
```
